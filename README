This is the SPARC-V8 ArchC 2.2 functional model.

This model has the system call emulation functions implemented,
so it is a good idea to turn on the ABI option.

To use acsim, the interpreted simulator:

    acsim sparcv8.ac -abi               (create the simulator)
    make -f Makefile.archc              (compile)
    sparcv8.x --load=<file-path> [args] (run an application)

The [args] are optional arguments for the application.

There are two formats recognized for application <file-path>:
- ELF binary matching ArchC specifications
- hexadecimal text file for ArchC


To generate binary utilities use:

    acbingen.sh -i<abs-install-path> -a<arch-name> sparcv8.ac

This will generate the tools source files using the architeture
name <arch-name> (if omitted, sparcv8 is used), copy them to the
binutils source tree, build and install them into the directory
<abs-install-path> (which -must- be an absolute path).
Use "acbingen.sh -h" to get information about the command-line
options available.

CHANGELOG:
==========

Version 1.0.0:

- ArchC 2.2 compliant

Version 0.7.8:

- Added binary utilities support files
- ArchC 2.0 compliant


Version 0.7.7-archc2.0beta3:

- Fixed an annoying bug which caused a segfault on the fft program (MiBench)


Version 0.7.6-archc2.0beta3:

- Added license headers


Version 0.7.5-archc2.0beta1:

- Model compliant with ArchC 2.0beta1


Version 0.7.5:

- Fixed 'unimplemented' instruction format and assembly syntax
- Fixed bug in mulscc_reg and mulscc_imm instructions (condition codes)
- npc initialization depends on ac_pc, so program can start at arbitrary address


Version 0.7.4:

- Included assembly language syntax information


Version 0.7.3:

- Fix bug in instruction MULSCC (used only for V7 multiplication)
- New REGS register bank holds the current register window from RB
- Use ArchC support for debug messages: ac_debug_model.H
- Use operator[] syntax to read register banks, which is faster


Version 0.7.2:

- Included optimization instruction methods for compiled simulation
- Separate nop instruction from sethi to optimize simulation


Version 0.7.1:

- Included file for GDB integration


Version 0.7.0:

- Model passed selected Mediabench and Mibench applications
